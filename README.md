I checked dupes and dropped flag = y where it seems to have no co-relation with other columns. Calculated average speed, day of week and distance. 

I was trying to populate zipcode which is erroring out and I was not sure how to resolve this.
Intention here was to get the zipcode and remove all rows with "error" value. 

Then, I was going to drop lat/long, ID and some other columns that are probably causing over-fitting. But didn't want to do that before I knew the full impact. 

Predictable model here is incomplete due to probably un-resolved issues above and not able to remove outliers.
